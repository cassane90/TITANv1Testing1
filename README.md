# TITAN: Hardware Forensic Diagnostic Suite

TITAN is a specialized hardware diagnostic platform designed for advanced device identification, fault analysis, and repair economics. It leverages forensic image scrutiny to identify legacy and modern hardware, calculate repair-vs-resale deltas, and provide localized procurement paths for parts and tools.

## Core Features

- **Forensic Scanning**: Analyzes serial numbers, FCC IDs, regulatory markings, and port layouts to identify hardware matches.
- **Financial Audit Node**: Calculates "Net Gain" by comparing "As-Is" broken values with "Restored" market values.
- **Instructional Protocols**: Provides high-stability search queries for DIY repair videos and guides (e.g., iFixit, YouTube).
- **Localized Sourcing**: Prioritizes regional retailers based on geographic anchoring while maintaining global market options.
- **Safety protocols**: Integrated high-voltage hazard detection and "Intelligent Protocol Alignment" for device category verification.

## Architecture

TITAN is built on a modern, ultra-low-latency tech stack:

- **Frontend**: React 18+ with Vite for instant builds and optimized production bundles.
- **Intelligence**: TITAN Neural Engine (Forensic reasoning via advanced multimodal models).
- **Backend**: Supabase for persistent forensic records and session management.
- **Styling**: Custom Vanilla CSS with hardware-terminal aesthetic.

## Deployment

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure the TITAN Core key:
   Create a `.env.local` file and add:
   ```env
   VITE_TITAN_CORE_KEY=your_forensic_auth_token_here
   ```
4. Launch the local environment:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Forensic Integrity

TITAN operates with a **Zero Tolerance Link Mandate**, ensuring all provided resources are functional and verified. It employs a **Unified Search Query Protocol** for parts and tools to guarantee 100% availability and avoid dead 404 links.
